               These parties have their own licenses to use their services, and some require you to obtain a 
               specific key to use their services. If you wish to use these services, you must agree to the 
               conditions set out by the respective service providers. Joaktree provides this software "as is". 
               In the event of a disruption or malfunction of the services, you should contact the 
               service provider. By selecting one of the following services you agree these conditions."
